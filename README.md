# work-Schedule

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? the motivation to create this appluication was in order too create a work schedule from time of 9am-5pm, in order to schedule work and that is color coded
to insure that you know what time is current and what times have passed as well as showing hopw much time is left
- What problem does it solve? this application solves the need of having to look at time, as well as being able to store information for work locally on your computer rather than having to use
things such as a note pad, the application is also color coded in the sense to make time telling mroe simple so that the user knows what time it is exactly.
- What did you learn? I learned how to use JS and local storage as well as jquery building this application to make the code shorter thus more efficient.
